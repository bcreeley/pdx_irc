      <t>
	This rfc describes an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol that was created
	for a Networking Protocols class project at Portland State University. The
	protocol allows for clients to connect to the chat server, joining and
	creating rooms, sending and receiving chat messages based
	on subscribed rooms, and leaving chat rooms.
      </t>
      <t>
	The server is implemented using TCP/IP sockets and assumes that the client
	application does this as well.
      </t>
    </abstract>

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>
        The purpose of this rfc is to explain how the interaction between the client
	and server for the IRC protocol being presented.  This is done using TCP/IP
	sockets for both the client and server.
      </t>
      <t>
	For this IRC protocol there is a central server which can consist of multiple
	chat rooms called channels. Each channel has a list of users that can communicate
	through this channel. When one user messages the channel the server will
	forward this message to every other user subscribed to this channel.
      </t>
      <t>
	The client can also request the available channels (chat rooms) and the users
	in a specified channel.  The server will receive this request and determine
	whether or not it is valid and relay the information back to the client
	who requested it.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Basic-Information" title="Basic Information">
      <t>
	Clients can connect to the server using TCP/IP sockets as long as the server
	is available. The server is always listening for new TCP connections on
	port 5013. As soon as the client successfully connects it can send any
	of the protocol's available messages.
      </t>
      <t>
	The client will use a predifined message structure to send all requests.
	In all cases the server will send a response back to the client. The message
	structure is explained in subsequent sections.
      </t>
      <t>
	In some cases the server will respond to the sending client, but as noted
	above other messages don't require a response from the server. When clients
	disconnect from the server, the server will remove the client from any of
	the channels they were subscribed to. It is up to the user on reconnection
	to reconnect to these channels.
     </t>
     <t>
	For simplicity each message has the same length. The first member of a message
	is the message type. This is followed by a union that defines the available
	messages. The message structure is described below.

	    The message structure used was defined in preceding sections. This will
	    be used along with the message types to build a request message. This is done by
	    flattening all of the data into an array of bytes. The requester
	    (most likely the client) will need to set the type, length, and in some cases
	    the payload field for the message to be valid. All of the messages require
	    a response from the server.

	      <t>
		MSG_TYPE_INVALID(client) - If no message type is specified then default of 0 is considered invalid.
		This makes it so the client doesn't accidentally send a valid default message type.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		MSG_TYPE_INVALID(server) - If no message type is specified then the default of 0 is considered invalid.
		This makes it so the server can't accidentally send back a success/fail (depending on which is 0).
	      </t>
	      <t>
		JOIN(client) - How the client either joins and/or creates a channel depending on whether or not it has already
		been created. The user does this by specifying their username and the channel they wish to join/create. If the
		user is already a member of the channel they get the response RESP_ALREADY_IN_CHANNEL. On success
		the server will send back RESP_SUCCESS in the resp_code.
	     </t>
	     <t>
		JOIN(server) - How the server sends the response back to the sending client. The server will fill the payload
		with the same data that was sent from the client. If the user is already in the channel the server will return
		RESP_ALREADY_IN_CHANNEL to the user. On success it will return RESP_SUCCESS.
	     </t>
	     <t>
		LEAVE(client) - How the client tells the server it wants to leave the channel specified in the payload. On success
		the client will receive a response from the server of RESP_SUCCESS. On failure the client will receive RESP_NOT_IN_CHANNEL.
	     </t>
	     <t>
		LEAVE(server) - The server will send a response of RESP_SUCCESS if the client was successfully removed from the specified
		channel.  If the client was not in the channel the server will respond with RESP_ALREADY_IN_CHANNEL. The
		server will fill the payload with that data the client sent on the LEAVE request.
	     </t>
	     <t>
		CHAT(client) - This is how the client sends messages to a specific channel they are subscribed to.
		If the user tries to send a message to a non-existent channel or a channel they are not part of
		then they will get a RESP_NOT_IN_CHANNEL from the server. On success the client will receive the
		payload it send along with a response of RESP_SUCCESS.
	     </t>
	     <t>
		CHAT(server) - The server uses the message to either forward the message to all users in the channel specified or
		to send a RESP_NOT_IN_CHANNEL to the client who supplied the CHAT message. The payload will be filled
		with the payload that was sent from the source client.
	     </t>
	     <t>
		LIST_CHANNELS(client) - The client is requesting the current list of channels from the server. The client should not
		fill the payload for this request. This request will either return RESP_SUCCESS and a list of the channel names separated
		by a ":" or a RESP_SERVER_HAS_NO_CHANNELS in the case that no channels have been created.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		LIST_CHANNELS(server) - If the server has no channels it will not fill the payload and the resp_code will be
		RESP_SERVER_HAS_NO_CHANNELS. Otherwise the server will fill the payload with all of the channels separated by
		a ":" and set the resp_code to RESP_SUCCESS.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		LIST_USERS(client) - The client uses this message to list the users of the channel specified. If the channel does
		not exist or if the user is not in the channel the server will respond with a resp_code of RESP_CANNOT_GET_USERS.
		Otherwise the server fills the payload with the channel's users separated by a ":" and sets the resp_code to
		RESP_SUCCESS.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		LIST_USERS(server) - The server will determine if the channel list specified is valid and return no payload
		and the resp_code RESP_CANNOT_GET_USERS if the request is invalid. Otherwise the server will fill the payload
		with the channel's users separated by a ":" and set resp_code to RESP_SUCCESS.

		  RESP_INVALID - When the client or server doesn't specifically set the response

		  RESP_INVALID_CHANNEL_NAME - The server sets the resp_code to this when a client

	      <t>
		  RESP_CANNOT_GET_USERS - The server sets this when the client tries to LIST_USERS

    <section anchor="Disconnecting-Information" title="Disconnecting ">
      <t>
	If a client disconnects from a server, the server will remove the user from any subscribed channels. If the
	client wants to reconnect to all of the channels it was previously connected to it needs to keep track
	and handle this on the client side.  The only information the server maintains about a user is their username
	and password.

    <section anchor="Security-Information" title="Security ">
      <t>
	This protocol is extremely insecure. The server stores usernames and passwords in plain text and none of the
	messages are encrypted. Any of the messages could be monitored to steal this information.
